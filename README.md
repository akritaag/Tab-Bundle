TAB BUNDLE
==============

Tab Bundle is a chrome extension developed by [Raj Vardhan](https://github.com/irajvardhan/) that lets you mark your bookmarks as either active or inactive, giving you greater control over them.

To get started: [Add this extension to chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-bundle/opglbdmblimolebijlohmopkjgnndbmk)

DESCRIPTION OF THE EXTENSION
--------------

Active bookmarks are highlighted in the popup menu. 

Bookmarks can be categorized into groups using Chrome's bookmark manager. All active bookmarks within a group can be opened in new tabs with a single click of a button. This is why it is named 'Tab bundle'.

Usage Example
--------------
There can be different scenarios for the use of this extension:

- Say, if you have 5 bookmarked links under folder 'Social Media', you may want to mark some of them as active to highlight the ones you visit more often. Links that you visit less often will be left marked inactive which is the default value.

- Say, you are working on a project. You make a new folder 'work' and add relevant links to it as bookmarks. Now if you want to continue your work the next day, before closing the browser you can mark those bookmarks as active which you want to come back and open again tomorrow. They will be highlighted when you open Chrome the next day until you mark them as inactive. 

Bookmarks can also be edited or deleted.

This way you have much greater control over your bookmarks and it is easier to manage them.

Something to Note
--------------
Note that this extension is meant only to extend the properties of a bookmark and associate a status(active or inactive) value with it.

To make full use of this, it is recommended that you organize your bookmarks into categories like (music, newz, work, etc) using Chrome's 'Bookmarks manager'. 

You can then at any time see your bookmarks in a tree-type structure in the extension's Popup UI. Status of any bookmark can be toggled by click of a button.
